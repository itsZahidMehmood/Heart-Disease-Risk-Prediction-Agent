Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses the UCI Heart Disease Dataset to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various medical attributes. It compares multiple machine learning models and selects the best one automatically.

📁 Dataset
Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset

Format: CSV

Target variable: target (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)

🔧 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Google Colab 💻

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

⚙️ ML Models Applied
Logistic Regression ✅ (Best performing)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

📊 Visualizations
Class balance plot

Correlation heatmap

Boxplot (Cholesterol by target)

Model accuracy comparison bar chart

ROC Curves for all models

Pairplot of selected features

🧠 Heart Disease Risk Agent
The project includes an interactive agent that:

Asks user for health input values (age, cholesterol, heart rate, etc.)

Automatically uses the most accurate model

Predicts the heart disease risk (yes/no)

▶️ Run the Project
Open Heart_Disease_Risk_Predictor.ipynb in Google Colab

Upload heart.csv if needed

Run all cells from top to bottom
